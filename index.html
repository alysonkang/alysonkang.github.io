    <h1>Pens</h1>
      <p>Pens are an extremely mundane object, common in our everyday lives. However, people have many different preferences when it comrs to the types of pen that they use. Some may not see the value in differing between pens, while others may insist on solely using a singular type of pen. Types of pens can range from ballpoint to gel, ranging in color, and tip size. Ultimately, there are a variety of factors that affect the overall quality of a pen, clearly defining the difference between a simple ballpoint pen lying around the house and a more expensive, intentionally bought pen.</p>
    <h1>The Sarasa Mark On</h1>
      <p>I prefer to use gel pens, because their ink is much smoother than ballpoint pens. However, a common problem with gel pens is a slow ink drying time, meaning that ink will smear on the page. This problem is accentuated during the use of a highlighter over gel ink, which can often smear words beyond recognition. Therefore, a fast-drying gel pen is necessary. </p>
    <br>
        <p>After trying several different types of pens, I have determined that the best pen is the Sarasa Mark On pen. It has extremely smooth and flowy black ink that works perfectly for writing or drawing. It also does not bleed through pages, which is another problem with certain ink-heavy pens. Most importantly, the ink is relatively smear-free, taking only a second or two to dry. </p>
    <br>
        <p>The Sarasa Mark On has a few faults, which is that it runs out of ink pretty quickly and its tip is a bit thicker than would be preferable. However, considering the quality of the ink and the overall pleasant user experience, it is the pen that I use for all purposes.</p>
